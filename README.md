# Drum Rack

A basic drum rack app built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: React

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The app allows you to set a sound and bpm on 6 different drum racks. Each sound can then be played creating a drum effect.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

You have been asked to create a metronome. Start with a range slider, play and stop buttons.

**Extension**

Allow the user to select different sounds from a list

NB: I chose to render 6 metronomes thus creating the drum rack.
